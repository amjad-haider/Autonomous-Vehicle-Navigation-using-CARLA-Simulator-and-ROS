# Project Description

This project implements an autonomous vehicle navigation system in a simulated urban environment using the CARLA Simulator and ROS. The system uses sensor data and control signals to enable a vehicle to navigate through traffic and reach a destination autonomously.

# System Requirements
- Windows 10 or higher
- WSL2 with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS installed
- NVIDIA graphics card with CUDA support (recommended)

# Software Requirements
- ROS2 Humble (installation instructions [here](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html))
- CARLA 0.9.14 (installation instructions [here](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/))
- python 3.7
